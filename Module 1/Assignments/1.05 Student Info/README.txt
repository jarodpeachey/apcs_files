___ PMR ____________________________________________________________

    * Using VSCode (my text editor of choice) with Java is more complex than I thought.
      It took several tries to install the right software. I ran
      into a compile issue that was fixed by moving the location
      of the JDK (Java Development Kit) download.

    * Found out that to read the output in the terminal in VSCode,    I need to run certain commands:
        1). javac StudentInfoCard.java
        2). java StudentInfoCard

    * Learned that formatting only using print() and println() is
      a lot more difficult than using a WSYWIG editor, or even HTML!

In the future, I'll be prepared for things to not go as expected on the first, or even 5th, try.
